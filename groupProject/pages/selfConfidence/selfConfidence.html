    <h1> Tips & Tricks to Improve Your Self Confidence </h1>
    <h2> Here are some things that may help.</h2>
    <ol>
      <li> Treat yourself- grooming and self care is important. It seems simple, but something as easy as styling
      your hair in a way you like can help.</li>
      <li> Identify negative aspects(or people) in your life- and avoid them.</li>
      <li> Take care of your body- its hard to feel good about yourself when you are not good to your body. Dieting, Sleep, Exercise, and Meditation are all things that can help yourself
      develop a healthy relationship to your self image.</li>
      <li> Live your life for yourself- stop comparaing youself to others. Disassoiate from istagram, stop comparing others lifes to your own. Everyone is different so
      every ones idea of beauty, success, and happiness is different.</li>
    </ol>
