    <h2>Challenges:</h2>
    <p>A challenge we encountered was trying to figure out how to do the third
       test for printing the functions in a different order.</p>
    <h2>Problems:</h2>
    <p>We ran into some issues with the setTimeout function at first since it was a little confusing. We managed to get it working after some Googling, as well as
    looking at the assignment page. Another small issue came up with trying to figure out how anonymous functions worked. We understand how they work now, but they can be a
  little confusing.</p>
    <h2>Results:</h2>
    <p>The results are apparent! Just open the console, refresh the page, and be amazed!</p>
