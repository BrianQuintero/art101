	<h2>Challenges:</h2>
	<p>The only challenge we faced was having to double check some JavaScript basics on W3Schools.com when we forgot how to do something.</p>
	<h2>Problems:</h2>
	<p>A problem we encountered was fordetting a + in the document.writeln() function when
		 combining text and variables together and ending up with an error for about 15 minutes.</p>
	<h2>Results:</h2>
	<p>The results here are evident! We managed to get everything in, and have a bit of fun with it in the process. We don't mean to brag, but it looks pretty great</p>
